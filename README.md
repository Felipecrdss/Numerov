# Numerov
Applications of the Numerov method to simple quantum systems using Python


****************************************************************************************
Abstract:

Numerov's numerical method is developed in a didactic way by using Python in its
Jupyter Notebook version 6.0.3 for three different quantum physical systems:
the hydrogen atom, a molecule governed by the Morse potential and for a quantum dot.
After a brief introduction to the Numerov method, the complete code to calculate 
the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the hydrogen atom is presented. 
The necessary code changes to calculate the other two examples are also provided in 
the sequel.

This code is explained in more detail in an article published in the
Brazilian Journal of Physics Teaching. As soon as it is published I 
will add the download link here.
